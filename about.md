I am a third year PhD student in Statistics at UC Berkeley.

My research interests lie on methodology of causal inference for spatial data. In particular, I am interested in cases with the presence of interference and unmeasured spatial confounding. My motivation comes from causal questions that arise in studies of climate impacts, anthropogenic impacts, and environmental policy evaluation.
