I am a third year PhD student in Statistics at UC Berkeley.

My research interests are in the development and application of causal inference methods for correlated space-time data. My motivation comes from the desire to demystify causal relationships in coupled human and natural systems -- impacts of climate on society and human activities on the environment.
