I am a fourth year PhD student in Statistics at UC Berkeley.

My research focuses on development of causal inference methods in complex observational studies. Specific areas include methods for causal inference with confounding, interference, satellite images, and spatial statistics. My projects are motivated by problems with potential for social and environmental impact. 

Outside of research, I enjoy drawing, crafting, and finding new music in different languages.
