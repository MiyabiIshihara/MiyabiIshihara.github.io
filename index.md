I am a third year PhD student in Statistics at UC Berkeley.

My research interests are on developing methods for causal inference and applying them to problems with complex spatial effects. In particular, I am interested in cases of interference and unmeasured spatial confounding. My motivation comes from questions that arise in studies of climate impacts, anthropogenic impacts, and environmental policy evaluation.

Outside of research, I enjoy drawing, crafting, and finding new music in different languages.
